class DynamoDBBackend(Backend):
    """
    DynamoDB is complicated.

    The issue is that we can't arbitrarily search/sort on columns (aka attributes).  In order to perform meaningful
    filtering on an attribute, then there must be an index which has that attriubte set as its HASH/Partition.
    Sorting or searching outside of indexes doesn't work the same way as with a typical SQL database (which will
    scan all records and search/sort accordingly).  With DynamoDB AWS fetches a maximum number of records out of the
    table, and then performs sorting/filtering on those.  The searching will always happen on a subset of the data,
    unless there are a sufficiently small number of records or the there is a supporting index.  For sorting, DynamoDB
    will not attempt to sort at all unless there is a supporting search attribute set in the index.

    "true" searching is only possible on indexes (either the primary index or a global secondary index).  For such
    cases, DynamoDB can perform basic searching operations against the HASH/Partition attribute in such an index.
    However, this still doesn't let us perform arbitrary sorting.  Instead, each index can have an optional RANGE/Sort key.
    If this exists, then we can sort in either ascending (the default) or descending order only if we have first
    filtered on the HASH/partition attribute.  This is the extent of sorting.  It is not possible to sort arbitrary attributes
    or specify multiple sort conditions.  To repeat a bit more succinctly: DynamoDB can only filter against an attribute
    that has an index set for it, and then can only sort filtered results if the index has the sort attribute set in the
    RANGE/Sort attribute of the index.

    This makes for very limited sorting capabilities.  To help with this a little, DynamoDB offers local secondary indexes.
    These indexes allow you to specify an additional sort attribute for a column that is already indexed (either via the
    primary index or a global secondary index).  In practice, changing the sort column means selecting a different index
    when filtering results.

    Let's bring it all together with an example.  Imagine we have a table that represents books, and has the following
    attributes:

    1. Author
    2. Title
    3. Year Published
    4. Genre

    The primary index for our table has:

    HASH/Partition: Author
    RANGE/Sort: Title

    We have a global secondary index:

    HASH/Partition: Genre
    RANGE/Sort: Title

    And a local secondary index:

    HASH/Partition: Author
    Range/Sort: Year Published

    This combination of indexes would allow us to filter/sort in the following ways:

    1. Filter by Author, sort by Title
    2. Filter by Author, sort by Year Published
    3. Filter by Genre, sort by Title

    Any other filter/sort options will become unreliable as soon as the table grows past the maximum result size.

        Our job is to figure out exactly which index to use, and build the key expression.

        We basically tell it everything we know, including what the "primary" condition is,
        i.e. the condition that we expect to match against the HASH attribute of an index.  This
        is *always* a `[column]=[value]` condition, because that is all DynamoDB supports, and
        the calling method must guarantee that there is an index on the table that has the given
        column as a HASH attribute.

        So why do we need to do anything else if the caller already knows which column it wants to
        sort on, and that there is an index with that column as a HASH attribute?  Because of the
        RANGE attribute, i.e. the second column in the index!  You can specify this second column
        to support sorting after searching on the HASH column, or to perform additional filtering
        after filtering on the hash column.  Local secondary indexes make it possible to create
        multiple indexes with the same HASH attribute but different RANGE attributes, which means
        that even if we know what the "primary" column is that we want to search on, there is still
        a possibility that we want to select different indexes depending on what our sort column
        is or what additional conditions we have in our query.

        for our query, build the appropriate key expression, and return a new list of conditions
